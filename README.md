# Explain
> Creating a simple & fast knowledge base for everyday use.
> I commonly ran into the problem of searching information over and over again, with this project I hope to alleviate this problem to some degree (atleast for myself) by making the aggregation of information faster as well as the finding of it.
> Nowadays one of the biggest problems is not that, we do not have access to information but to filter it down efficiently so that one can use it.

## General Information
- This project aims to be a hacky editor based knowledgebase/wiki
- In case you find yourself regularily doing one of the following:
  - Searching for some Information which you already retained yesterday
  - Rereading the same stuff the get insights which you already worked yourself through
  - Loosing your old notes and then instead writing new ones....
- Make the friction to note down, retain and use your knowledge as fast as possible
- I always wanted to create something that 1000s of people may find useful, so it is best to start with something that I may find very useful myself ;)

## Project Status
Project is _in progress_
<!-- Project is: _in progress_ / _complete_ / _no longer being worked on_. If you are no longer working on it, provide reasons why. -->


## Room for Improvement
Currently the project is at an early prototype stage, but by putting it out there. 
I will feel more compelled to further work on it and make it compatible also to other devices, except for my own.

Room for improvement:
- Visualization via Markdown
- Saving & Visualizing Files 
- Saving & Visualizing Images
- Maybe easy creation of Anki Cards

To do:
- Search by Tags
- Make it a bash script
- Write a setup.py
